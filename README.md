# kubernetes-faster
Example repository with configuration for a Kubernetes cluster on AWS GovCloud. Certificates are included and not redacted, but the cluster in question is not running anywhere.

### This repo does not use EKS, AKS, or any managed Kubernetes tooling.  It is meant for getting Kubernetes up and running quickly on nontypical cloud environments like AWS GovCloud or Azure Government where these managed services may not exist.

## Folders

### Kops - Cluster Set Up

### Helm - Starting cluster applications & tooling
