# kubernetes-faster
Fully configured Kubernetes with best practices and tooling built in

### This repo does not use EKS, AKS, or any managed Kubernetes tooling.  It is meant for getting Kubernetes up and running quickly on nontypical cloud environments like AWS GovCloud or Azure Government where these managed services may not exist.
